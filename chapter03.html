Inside the tent Francis found... people. In the room there were about ten men and women behind a fence chained to weights. The tent walls were covered in blood, it was disgusting. There was
a trough filled with a horrible assortment of "food" in the pen with them, presumably to keep them fat. Francis quickly went out to the guards bodies and searched them for keys. He rushed
back into the tent and began unlocking the prisoners. "We need to be quiet and sneak out of here" Francis proclaimed to the group. They all nodded in agreement. Francis gave some of them
the knives he found on the guards. They began exiting the tent. However, when they exited the tent their was a guard just about to enter. He rushed at Francis with a katana, Francis panicked
and shot him with his revolver. The gun made a very loud bang, and the rest of the guards came running. One of the prisoners grabbed the katana and got ready to fight. About ten guards came
running around the corner, most of them wielding knives, a few with katanas and one big guy holding a shotgun. Francis quickly aimed his gun at the big guys head. He shot him just in time
before the man could get a shot off. Francis only had eight more bullets so he had to be accurate. The fight became quite reckless, two of the prisoners were chopped up but one of them was
able to grab the mans shot gun and help kill the remaining guards.

Francis turned to the remaining prisoners, "I haven't got any food but you's are welcome to stay with me for awhile, I have a shack not far from here." One of the women turned to Francis "We
all come from a farm east of here, there should be food there. We were all captured when we were exploring looking for supplies, you're welcome to stay with us, you're our savior!" Francis
smirked a little. "I'd love to.." he replied. And off they went.
