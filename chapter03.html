When Francis walked into the tent his jaw almost hit the floor in amazment, the room was filled with food. There was meat like beef and fruit and so much more. Francis searched the room and
found a rugsack and quickly began piling food into it. Francis took as much as he could possibly carry, the rugsack was loaded to the brim with food. After he was finished Francis began to
sneak out of the tent. Luckily, none of the other guards seemed to notice any of the comotion that had been going on around the food tent. Francis began to attempt to sneak out of the camp
site. He crouched down and started moving very slowly. However, the rugsack was making it quite difficult. Francis managed to make it out in the end anyway.
