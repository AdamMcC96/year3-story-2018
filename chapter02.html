Francis eventually came to, he tried to open his eyes but all he could see was black and his hands were bound. He gathered that he was probably blindfolded. He could hear a few men talking to
his right. "Boy dudn't look like he gots much meat left on um." uttered one groggy voice. "Yeah, suppose, but I sure bet he'd make a good slave now." replied another
slightly higher voice. Francis could smell that one of the men was smoking something, I didn't smell like tabaco. It made Francis start coughing violently. "Oh, the boys
wake." proclaimed the first voice. He walked over to Francis and removed the blindfold. They were both completely bald with jagged teeth, one was much bigger than the other
and they both had horrible breath. "Now wot we gon do wit you boy" asked the larger man as he pressed a knife up to Francis' face. Without hesitation Francis swung his left foot wildly at the man
and managed to kick the knife into his eye. The man dropped dead and the other stood there scared for a second. Francis' hands were bound to a pole in ground, he kept kicking it and managed
to knock the pole out from the sand and free his hands. As Francis began to step over his hands the other man rushed toward him with another knife. Francis quickly ducked out of the way and
headbutted the man, then began choking him with the rope. He could feel the man gasp for air, it felt like hours for Francis. "I can't believe I'm killing again..." he thought.
