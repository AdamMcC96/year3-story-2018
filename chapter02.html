Francis eventually came to, he tried to open his eyes but all he could see was black and his hands were bound. He gathered that he was probably blindfolded. He could hear a few men talking to
his right. "Boy dudn't look like he gots much meat left on um." uttered one groggy voice. "Yeah, suppose, but I sure bet he'd make a good slave now." replied another
slightly higher voice. Francis could smell that one of the men was smoking something, I didn't smell like tobacco. It made Francis start coughing violently. "Oh, the boys
wake." proclaimed the first voice. He walked over to Francis and removed the blindfold. They were both completely bald with jagged teeth, one was much bigger than the other
and they both had horrible breath. "Now wot we gon do wit you boy" asked the larger man as he pressed a knife up to Francis' face. Without hesitation Francis swung his left foot wildly at the man
and managed to kick the knife into his eye. The man dropped dead and the other stood there scared for a second. Francis' hands were bound to a pole in ground, he kept kicking it and managed
to knock the pole out from the sand and free his hands. As Francis began to step over his hands the other man rushed toward him with another knife. Francis quickly ducked out of the way and
head butted the man, then began choking him with the rope. He could feel the man gasp for air, it felt like hours for Francis. "I can't believe I'm killing again..." he thought.

Francis quickly used the mans knife to cut his hands free. He then began searching the two bodies and found his own revolver and another knife. Francis finally had time to look around and evaluate
his surroundings, he seemed to be inside some sort of old army tent. While examining the room he found what appeared to be small map. It was of a small camp with a tent circled in red, Francis gathered
that this was probably the army tent he was in. He then noticed another tent at the back of the camp labeled "FOOD". Francis' eyes lit up, he hasn't had something to eat for three whole days. It was
decided, Francis was going to try steal some food. He could hear voices at the front of the tent so he decided to climb under the back of the tent. He peered around the tent and made out about ten to
fifteen men. Francis looked at the map and estimated that if he was to sneak around the back of some of the tents he'd be able to make it their without an issue. Luckily it was quite windy and sand
was blowing everywhere so that would help obscure him. So he began to slowly and silently approach the food tent. On his was there he lost his footing on some sand and almost got spotted but luckily
he managed to get out of his line of sight in time. He eventually got to the tent, he could hear two men inside talking about how much food they had, the both appeared to be at the tent's entrance.
Francis purposely made some noise at the front of tent. Only one of the men came out to check it out. Francis ripped some fabric from his scarf and when the man turned his back he rushed behind him.
With one hand he stabbed him in the back of the throat and with the other he used the fabric to silence his screams of pain. He dragged the body behind the tent and left it there. After a while the
other man came out to check what was taking so long. Francis tried to rush this man too but he turned around and attempted to stab Francis, but Francis used the mans own knife against him and
stabbed him in the neck. The man screamed but Francis just about muffled him. He then walked through the tent and was shocked by what he saw.
