Francis awoke to the overwhelming smell of decaying bodies. The sun was glaring through a crack in the ceiling of his 'shack', if you could call such a thing a shack.
Francis had dirty red hair, or at least it was supposed to be red, clear amber eyes and a wrinkled face, not because he was very old, it's just what happens when you live in
the dessert for too long. He was very scruffy, possibly due to his circumstances, and wore tattered leathers or any old clothes he could find. Francis eventually pulled
himself out of his rucksack and made his way out the door. The sun was almost blinding, Francis donned his goggles and pulled his scarf over his nose, and off he went, into
the desert, to look for something to eat, that wasn't... 'rotten'.

Hours went by, Francis couldn't find anything to cease the hunger inside. Then he suddenly heard a strange banging noise off in the distance. It appeared to be coming from
behind the sand dune off to his left. Francis took a deep breath, drew his revolver and cautiously approached the sound. He peeped over the sand dune and saw a bizarre
sight. It was a sweaty fat man, about thirty five, talking to a dummy, made up of scrap materials and a skull. "The economy isn't as forgiving as it used to be Gregory."
He grumbled. Francis was over come with empathy for this man, he could clearly see that the loneliness and hunger has drove this man crazy. But then, a thought popped into
Francis' head "Wait.. how is he so fat? He must have food.. somehow.". Francis decided he was going to try steal some of his food, but just as he went to scale down the
sand dune he felt a thump on the back of his head and everything went pitch black.
