Francis awoke to the overwhelming smell of decaying bodies. The sun was glaring through a crack in the ceiling of his 'shack', if you could call such a thing a shack.
Francis had dirty red hair, or at least it was supposed to be red, clear amber eyes and a wrinkled face, not because he was very old, it's just what happens when you live in
the dessert for too long. He was very scruffy, possibly due to his circumstances, and wore tattered leathers or any old clothes he could find. Francis eventually pulled
himself out of his rucksack and made his way out the door. The sun was almost blinding, Francis donned his goggles and pulled his scarf over his nose, and off he went, into
the desert, to look for something to eat, that wasn't... 'rotten'.
